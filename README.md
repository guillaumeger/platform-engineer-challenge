# Platform Engineer Take-Home Exercise

Welcome to the Platform Engineer Take-Home Exercise! This project is designed to assess your expertise in Kubernetes, Terraform or Helm, RBAC, and your ability to create scalable and production-ready infrastructure solutions.

Your goal is to enable platform users to utilize a Kubernetes cluster for both development and production, providing a flexible environment that accommodates varying skill levels within their teamsâ€”from interns to senior staff.

## Objective

This exercise aims to evaluate your ability to:

1. **Document Operational Procedures:** Provide clear instructions for setting up a local Kubernetes environment.
2. **Infrastructure Configuration:** Utilize Terraform **or** Helm to configure the locally created Kubernetes cluster with appropriate RBAC for platform users.
3. **User Documentation:** Develop clear guides for users to interact with the infrastructure repository.
4. **Design Scalable Solutions:** Create strategies that support scaling across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
5. **Production-Ready Strategies:** Outline methods to transition the local Kubernetes cluster to a production environment.

**Note:** For this exercise, assume that user authentication to the Kubernetes clusters is hypothetical. The focus is on your approach to implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for platform users who will develop and operate their services.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your local machine before starting:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v1.0 or higher) **or** [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) (v1.18 or higher)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) or [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) for setting up a local Kubernetes cluster

## Exercise Tasks

### 1. OPERATOR.md: Setting Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster

**Objective:** Provide a clear guide to set up a local Kubernetes cluster.

**Requirements:**

- **File Creation:** Create a file named `OPERATOR.md`.
- **Content Should Include:**
  - Steps to install and configure a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or Kind.
  - Verification methods to ensure the cluster is running correctly.
  - Troubleshooting tips for common setup issues.

**Tips:**

- Use straightforward language.
- Include command-line instructions with explanations.
- Add screenshots or diagrams as needed.

### 2. Infrastructure Configuration: Terraform or Helm

**Objective:** Develop infrastructure as code to configure the local Kubernetes cluster as outlined in `OPERATOR.md`, enabling platform users to create and access their namespaces with appropriate RBAC.

**Requirements:**

- **Choice of Tool:** You may implement this task using **Terraform** **or** **Helm**, depending on your preference.

  - Include a `README.md` within the chosen configuration directory (`terraform/` or `helm/`) detailing how to deploy the infrastructure using the selected tool alongside the local Kubernetes cluster.

**Tips:**

- Reference any prerequisites from `OPERATOR.md` necessary for deployment.
- Ensure the infrastructure scripts/charts interact seamlessly with the locally configured Kubernetes cluster.

### 3. USER.md: User Interaction Guide

**Objective:** Provide platform users with detailed instructions on interacting with the repository to create and manage their namespaces.

**Requirements:**

- **File Creation:** Create a file named `USER.md`.
- **Content Should Explain:**
  - How users can request a new namespace.
  - RBAC implementation.
  - Purpose of different namespaces (if multiple exist).
  - Expected outcomes after a namespace request is made.
- **Examples:** Include practical examples of common commands and workflows.

**Tips:**

- Focus on clarity and usability.
- Assume users have basic Kubernetes knowledge but may be unfamiliar with your specific setup.

### 4. SCALING.md: Scaling Across Multiple Clusters

**Objective:** Detail strategies and modifications needed to scale your solution across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

**Requirements:**

- **File Creation:** Create a file named `SCALING.md`.
- **Content Should Discuss:**
  - Managing multiple clusters using Terraform **or** Helm.
  - Strategies for centralized RBAC management.
  - Automation tools or scripts to facilitate scaling.
  - Considerations for consistency and manageability across clusters.

**Tips:**

- Highlight potential challenges and propose solutions.
- Mention any tools or technologies that can aid in scaling.

### 5. PRODUCTION.md: Preparing the Kubernetes Cluster for Production

**Objective:** Outline the steps and considerations needed to transition the local Kubernetes cluster to a production-ready state.

**Requirements:**

- **File Creation:** Create a file named `PRODUCTION.md`.
- **Content Should Cover:**
  - **Security Enhancements:** Network policies and secrets management.
  - **High Availability & Fault Tolerance:** Strategies to ensure cluster resilience.
  - **Monitoring & Logging Setups:** Tools and configurations for effective monitoring and logging.
  - **Backup & Disaster Recovery Plans:** Methods to safeguard data and ensure recovery.
  - **Performance Optimization:** Techniques to enhance cluster performance.
- **Recommendations:** Provide actionable advice and best practices.

**Tips:**

- Be thorough and focus on critical aspects of production environments.
- Reference tools and technologies that support production readiness.

## Deliverables

Your submission should include the following:

1. **Documentation Files:**
   - `OPERATOR.md`
   - `USER.md`
   - `SCALING.md`
   - `PRODUCTION.md`

2. **Infrastructure Configuration:**
   - **If using Terraform:**
     - All necessary `.tf` configuration files.
     - A `README.md` with deployment instructions.
